# 3DSoftEngine
3D soft engine built in Javascript

# Background

A 3D software engine is a visual engine built only under the CPU. Building a 3D software engine helps to understand the basics and the foundations of modern 3D development in computer science. Building a soft engine will help understand the foundations of OpenGL/WebGL and/or DirectX.

# Underlying Principles

To understand 3D, the student must understand linear algebra and matrix projection.

By reading articles on 3D projection, understanding comes with this:

– we start by a 3D object centered on itself
– the same object is then moved into the virtual 3D world by translation, scaling or rotation operations via matrices
– a camera will look at this 3D object positioned in the 3D world
– the final projection of all that will be done into a 2D space which is your screen

# Prerequisites

For Javascript developers, include babylon.math in your project. Optional: install babylon.js to your computer.

# Intangibles

This is an ongoing project.
